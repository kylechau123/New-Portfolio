# My Portfolio

## Description 
This is portfolio website was created using React. Using React I was able to utilize all the functionalities of it including React icons, HTML formatting with React, and ease of website building. This was created with the knowledge of using JavaScript as a backend language to help implement the HTML functionality as well as other things such as merging pages together. Through this project you can see how much has changed from the start to the end of the Columbia Coding Boot Camp course. I originally had a repo with all my previous work in it but some stuff happened and things weren't working anymore on it so I had to restart on another repo with new files and changed a lot of the work on it.
